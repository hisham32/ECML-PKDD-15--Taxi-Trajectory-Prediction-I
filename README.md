# ECML-PKDD-15--Taxi-Trajectory-Prediction-I

This is the program I used when taking part in the ECML-PKDD-15--Taxi-Trajectory-Prediction-I. 

The underlying model is very simple and the program was designed so that the learning (on-line) and prediction steps are very fast. A more detailed explanation can be found in the .pdf

Possible improvements include Bag-Of-Words, decision trees approach...
